      <div class="modal-body">
<p>
By utilizing this website, you agree to be bound by these terms and conditions. This is a legal agreement ("Agreement") between you and Phnom Penh Securities ("PPS ZuluTrade") for use of the website, data, ZuluTrade electronic trading platform, and products and services which you selected or initiated, which may include the ZuluTrade trading platform and third party signal providers ("Products and Services").
</p>

<h4>ZuluTrade Platform</h4>
<p>The ZuluTrade trading platform is an auto-trading system. The ZuluTrade platform receives trading signals from third party signal providers. Once the signal is received, ZuluTrade validates the signal and confirms whether it is consistent with the investor’s account settings and preferences. If the signal is accepted, ZuluTrade sends the trading signal to the investor’s broker for execution.</p>

<h4>Risk of Loss</h4>
<p>The risk of loss in trading Forex can be substantial. You should therefore carefully consider whether such trading is suitable for you in light of your financial condition. When trading on margin, you may sustain a total loss of the initial margin funds and any additional funds that you deposit with your broker to establish or maintain a position in the Forex market. Before deciding to trade and/or invest, you should carefully consider your objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or all of your initial investment and therefore you should not trade or invest money that you cannot afford to lose.</p>
<p>By viewing this website and trading on the ZuluTrade trading platform, you fully understand and agree that Forex markets are subject to numerous implicit and explicit risks, none of which ZuluTrade can control or influence. You therefore acknowledge and agree that all trading is solely at your own risk. You should be aware of all the risks associated with trading and you should seek advice from an independent financial advisor before trading.</p>
<p>You also agree to bear complete responsibility for your choice of signal provider(s) and acknowledge that ZuluTrade has not and will not make any specific recommendations to you upon which you are entitled to rely. You also understand that the information disseminated on this website represents impersonal, disinterested opinions and commentary of ZuluTrade and its employees and agents, but that the information does not constitute investment advice or a recommendation to trade using any specific signal provider.</p>
<p>We recommend investors visit the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC") website at the following address before trading: <a href="http://www.cftc.gov/cftc/cftcbeforetrade.htm" target="_parent" rel="nofollow">http://www.cftc.gov/cftc/cftcbeforetrade.htm</a></p>

<h4>Third Party Signal Providers</h4>
<p>ZuluTrade makes no guarantee, implied or otherwise, as to the information provided to investors by third party signal providers, or through their respective websites. As such, use of these third party signal providers is at the investor’s own risk. You acknowledge and agree that ZuluTrade is not responsible for any shortcomings, trading system errors, charging or billing errors, misrepresentations, or any wrongdoing on the part of said third party signal provider(s). ZuluTrade recommends investors review the signal provider’s policies regarding trading system errors, privacy, billing, errors and omissions, and related issues before investing.</p>
<p>The returns for signal providers listed throughout this website are hypothetical in that they represent returns in a model account. The model account may rise or fall by the exact single contract profit and loss achieved by clients trading actual money pursuant to the listed system’s trading signals on the appropriate dates, or if no actual client profit or loss is available, by the hypothetical single contract profit and loss of trades generated by the system’s trading signals over the test period. The hypothetical model account begins with the initial capital level listed, and is reset to that amount each month. The percentage returns reflect inclusion of commissions, spreads, interest, fees, and the cost of the system. The commission, spread, interest and fee costs included in the calculations varies per system.</p>
<p>The actual percentage gains/losses experienced by investors will vary depending on many factors, including, but not limited to: starting account balances, market behavior, the investor’s account settings, and the performance of the signal provider. Because of this, actual percentage gains/losses experienced by investors may be materially different than the percentage gains/losses as presented on this website.</p>
<p>You understand that there can be no guarantee that your use of the signal providers or the information disseminated on this website will result in profits. Further, you understand that your use of the signal providers or the information disseminated on this website may result in substantial losses.</p>
<p>Please read carefully the CFTC required disclaimer regarding hypothetical results below.</p>
<p>HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS HAVE MANY INHERENT LIMITATIONS, SOME OF WHICH ARE DESCRIBED BELOW. NO REPRESENTATION IS BEING MADE THAT ANY ACCOUNT WILL OR IS LIKELY TO ACHIEVE PROFITS OR LOSSES SIMILAR TO THOSE SHOWN; IN FACT, THERE ARE FREQUENTLY SHARP DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS AND THE ACTUAL RESULTS SUBSEQUENTLY ACHIEVED BY ANY PARTICULAR TRADING PROGRAM. ONE OF THE LIMITATIONS OF HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS IS THAT THEY ARE GENERALLY PREPARED WITH THE BENEFIT OF HINDSIGHT. IN ADDITION, HYPOTHETICAL TRADING DOES NOT INVOLVE FINANCIAL RISK, AND NO HYPOTHETICAL TRADING RECORD CAN COMPLETELY ACCOUNT FOR THE IMPACT OF FINANCIAL RISK OF ACTUAL TRADING. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ABILITY TO WITHSTAND LOSSES OR TO ADHERE TO A PARTICULAR TRADING PROGRAM IN SPITE OF TRADING LOSSES ARE MATERIAL POINTS WHICH CAN ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT ACTUAL TRADING RESULTS. THERE ARE NUMEROUS OTHER FACTORS RELATED TO THE MARKETS IN GENERAL OR TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ANY SPECIFIC TRADING PROGRAM WHICH CANNOT BE FULLY ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE PREPARATION OF HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS AND ALL WHICH CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT TRADING RESULTS.</p>
